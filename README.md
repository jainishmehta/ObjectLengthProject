# ObjectLengthProject

Using OpenCV to measure the length of an object, more specifically a foot. This is done using Python. To test this, I use PyCharm and run the program, which then outputs what the program recognizes as an object and its relative size. To add calibration, I use a coin to see if the results are accurate and if not, they should be scalable through so.
